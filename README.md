## ✨ Key Features

### 🏷️ Smart Drive Recognition
- **Auto-label drives** based on content analysis (detects OS installations, LXD storage, boot partitions)
- **Persistent tracking** by UUID - drives remember their labels even after unplugging
- **Tree view display** showing disks and their partitions in a clean hierarchy
- **LXD/LXC detection** - automatically identifies and displays container storage pools

### 🔧 Advanced Management
- **Partition tools** - format, resize, check, repair partitions with safety confirmations
- **Backup & Restore** - 4 powerful methods (dd, tar, rsync, btrfs snapshots)
- **Cloud backup** - Upload to S3-compatible storage (AWS, Backblaze, DigitalOcean, Wasabi)
- **Clone with auto-resize** - Clone bootable drives to larger targets with automatic partition expansion

### 🤖 AI-Powered (Optional)
- **Semantic search** - Find drives using natural language ("my backup drive")
- **Error analysis** - AI troubleshooting for disk errors and SMART failures
- Powered by Claude AI (requires API key)

### 🚀 Maintenance Tools
- Disk error checking (badblocks, e2fsck, btrfs, xfs)
- SMART health monitoring
- Space analysis (find largest directories)
- System log analysis for drive-related issues

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Media servers** (Plex, Jellyfin, Kodi) - Track your movie/music drives
- **NAS setups** - Manage multiple storage drives
- **Pi clusters** - LXD/LXC container storage management
- **Backup systems** - Organize backup drives
- **Developers** - Track project drives and test media
- **Makers** - Manage SD cards for different Pi projects

## 📋 Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi** (any model with USB ports)
- **Raspberry Pi OS** (Raspbian) - tested on Bookworm, should work on Bullseye+
- **Node.js 18+** (usually pre-installed on modern Pi OS)
- **Root access** for drive operations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nfodor/diskmgt.git
cd diskmgt

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create alias for easy access
echo "alias dm='/home/pi/dev/diskmgt/dm-sudo'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### First Run

```bash
# Launch the interactive menu
dm
```

You'll see a beautiful menu like this:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                     📀 Disk Manager 📀                       ║

## 📖 Detailed Usage

### Sudo Setup (Recommended)

Most disk operations require root privileges. Set up aliases that automatically use sudo:

```bash
# Remove any old aliases
sed -i '/alias diskmgt=/d' ~/.bashrc
sed -i '/alias dm=/d' ~/.bashrc

# Add sudo-enabled aliases
echo "alias diskmgt='/home/pi/dev/diskmgt/dm-sudo'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias dm='/home/pi/dev/diskmgt/dm-sudo'" >> ~/.bashrc

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now you can run with automatic sudo:
```bash
dm           # Automatically runs with sudo, uses your config
diskmgt      # Same as above (alternative command name)
```

**How it works:**
- Runs as root for admin operations (mount, fsck, etc.)
- Uses YOUR config at `~/.config/diskmgt/`
- Preserves your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- No need to manually type `sudo`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Runs with root privileges automatically
- ✅ Preserves your user config directory
- ✅ Keeps your API keys and settings
- ✅ No need to type `sudo` every time

### Alternative: Manual sudo
```bash
echo "alias dm='node /home/pi/dev/diskmgt/index.js'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Always run with sudo
sudo dm
```

**Note:** Manual sudo uses root's config at `/root/.config/diskmgt/` instead of your user's config.

See [SUDO_SETUP.md](SUDO_SETUP.md) for detailed setup information.

## Storage

Drive information is stored in: `~/.config/diskmgt/drives.json`
Backup configuration is stored in: `~/.config/diskmgt/backup-config.json`

## Backup Methods

### 1. Block-level (dd) - Bit-for-bit copy
**PROS:** Complete exact copy, bootable, includes all hidden data
**CONS:** Slow, large files, includes empty space, can't resize
**USE:** System drives, recovery scenarios, forensics

### 2. Filesystem-level (tar) - File-by-file copy
**PROS:** Fast, compressed, excludes empty space, flexible restore
**CONS:** Loses some metadata, not bootable without setup, requires mounted
**USE:** Data drives, user files, regular backups

### 3. Incremental (rsync) - Only changes
**PROS:** Fast subsequent backups, space-efficient, deduplication
**CONS:** More complex restore, dependency chain
**USE:** Daily backups, large datasets, limited storage

### 4. Snapshot-based (btrfs) - Copy-on-write
**PROS:** Instant, space-efficient, incremental, point-in-time
**CONS:** Filesystem-specific, complex, requires supported FS
**USE:** Servers, databases, version control

## Cloud Backup

Supports S3-compatible providers:
- AWS S3
- Backblaze B2
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Wasabi
- MinIO (self-hosted)

Configure with "Configure cloud backup" menu option. Backups can stream directly to S3 without local storage.
